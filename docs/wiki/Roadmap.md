# Roadmap

Forgeflow is currently a local-first developer workflow for Claude Code and Codex.

## Current Focus

Forgeflow now has the local install, health, repair, rollback, release, docs, demo, and template-installer pieces needed for broader use. The next phase is measuring review quality and context efficiency across real projects.

## Evaluation Work

- collect local review outcome records
- compare no-agent, single-agent, and Forgeflow reviews
- measure false positives, accepted findings, review time, and auto-fix quality
- measure context-pack savings and budget violations across real projects
- publish a lightweight evaluation report when enough data exists

## Recently Added

- Forgeflow rebrand and public README/wiki source
- Codex skills and local harness sync
- local review context packs
- memory indexing and compact memory context
- implementation scope manifests and per-agent packets
- context savings telemetry and summaries
- configurable context budgets and budget seeding
- project-local health repair helper
