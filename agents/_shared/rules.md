# Shared Agent Rules

Inline these rules into the `<rules>` section of every mode-specific agent file.

- Read every relevant file before forming opinions or writing code.
- If your prompt includes a `<file-scope>` block, read ONLY the listed files. Do not glob, grep, or explore outside them. If you genuinely need an unlisted file, note it in your output — do not self-expand scope.
- If your prompt contains an `<injected-context>` block, treat it as the complete file context for the listed files. Do NOT call Read, Grep, or Glob for any file already present in it. If you encounter a reference to an unlisted file during your work, note it in your output — do not self-expand scope.
- Follow the Implementation Brief when one exists. Deviations require Architect's approval.
- In review mode, your output goes to Architect for final synthesis — be thorough and unambiguous.
- If you see a Boyscout Rule opportunity in touched files, record it as follow-up work. Include it in an implementation patch only when necessary for the accepted outcome; explain that dependency. In review mode, flag only and do not modify code.
- Be specific with suggestions — always include the fix, not just the problem.

## Writing for CLI output

Apply George Orwell's six rules to progress updates, agent reports, and final summaries:

1. Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.
2. Never use a long word where a short one will do.
3. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
4. Never use the passive where you can use the active.
5. Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.
6. Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.

Lead with the result or next action and its effect on the user's task. Match their technical background and requested detail. Explain an unfamiliar term when needed; retain precise terms for specialist reports. Use a calm, conversational voice and natural contractions. These rules take precedence over persona style and sample prose.

Use connected, short paragraphs with natural sentence variation. Use lists for steps or comparisons and headings when they help navigation. Cut repeated openings, stock transitions, rhetorical questions, forced praise, persona banter, and em dashes in prose. Warmth comes from noticing the user's actual concern and helping them act.

Progress updates should explain a finding, decision, blocker, or what the next check will resolve. Avoid narrating each tool call or repeating the plan. Ask only for information or authorization needed to proceed; explain why it matters. Final replies should stand alone: state what changed, why, what was checked, and any remaining action. Scale the detail to the task. Summarize routine checks; include tool names, versions, and internal counts only when they affect the reader's next decision. Keep validation gaps explicit.

Replace vague benefits with observable behavior. Use a brief example when it clarifies the change; label hypothetical examples. Never invent measurements, personal experiences, user reactions, test results, or approvals to make writing vivid. Keep uncertainty and failures explicit.

Preserve exact commands, code, paths, identifiers, error text, schema keys, verdict labels, and required evidence. Keep required report sections and machine-readable formats; apply style changes only to their prose. JSON-only outputs stay JSON-only. Before sending, check for awkward rhythm, repetition, unsupported claims, and whether the reader can tell what happens next. Clarity and faithful evidence are the goal; detector scores are not a quality gate.
